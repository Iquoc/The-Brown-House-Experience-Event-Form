# The-Brown-House-Experience-Event-Form

<b>This is a full-stack website application developed by a team of Computer Science Undergraduates at DePaul University for a client in the Senior Capstone course.  Because the application was handed off to the client, complete files and structures have been omitted.  <br>  I worked on the backend team, mostly involved in: database connect/read/write; waitlist functionality; waitlist flow chart; and, architecture design.</b>

<h2> Main File:</h2>

<b>Here are examples of using routing in React.js, efficient method calling, code commenting, initializing database connection, and appropriate handling of commands between separate Python files.</b>

![db_connect!](/main/main_database_connect.jpg)
<b>The above code is one of the initial calls in the Main File and is responsible for initializing and establishing the database connection.  The singleton/instance of the database connection allows for one connection call and reuse without having to waste resources on establishing the same connection each time the web application needs to read/write to database.<br></b>
![create_form!](/main/create_form.jpg)
<b>The above code uses routing in React.js, comments to organize the method calls and its purpose, appropriate variable naming conventions, and handling of commands between separate Python files.<br></b>
![delete_form!](/main/delete_form.jpg)
<b>The above code uses routing in React.js, appropriate variable naming conventions, and handling of commands between separate Python files.<br></b>
![delete_participant!](/main/delete_participant.jpg)
<b>The above code uses routing in React.js, appropriate variable naming conventions, and handling of commands between separate Python files.<br></b>
![ext_year!](/main/extrapolate_year.jpg)
<b>The above code uses appropriate variable naming conventions, and efficient method organization.<br></b>
![wl!](/main/waitlist.jpg)
<b>The above code uses comments to organize the method calls and its purpose, appropriate variable naming conventions, and handling of commands between separate Python files.<br></b>

<h2> Database File:</h2>

<b>Due to the sensitive nature of database connection and read/writing, I can only provide generic examples.  This is a draft of using MongoDB database and collection calls and CSV formatting for exportation.</b>
